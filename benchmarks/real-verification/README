For each folder, if there is corresponding sample folder (FOLDERNAME-sample), that means we grasp the sample of the code to do instrumentation. Otherwise, we instrument the code itself.

For the apps we instrument the code itself, when we compile the app, we mainly need to do the following settings when compile the app:

Setting CC="PATH/OF/clang" CXX="PATH/OF/clang++" CFLAGS="-flto -fPIC -v -g" CXXFLAGS="-flto -fPIC -v -g" LDFLAGS="PATH/OF/libprober.so" .

The corresponding script is in the folder with name NUM-BenchmarkName. The "NUM" in the name is just a id number of the app we used during our work to keep it consistent with the following paper: 

T. Ye, L. Zhang, L. Wang, and X. Li. An empirical study on detecting and fixing buffer overflow bugs. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST), pages 91â€“101, April 2016

For the apps we instrument the code sample, just need to run Makefile under each file.

Two objects come from vectors, we don't handle this case, including app psi-0.12, libwpd-0.8.12.

The folders not belong to our benchmark subject, just the required libraries to support other apps to build successfully, including gd-2.0.33.
