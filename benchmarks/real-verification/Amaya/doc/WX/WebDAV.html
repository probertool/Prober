<h3 id="About">About WebDAV</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV (WWW Distributed Authoring and
Versioning)</a> is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol, which allows
users to collaboratively edit and manage web resources on remote servers. It
aims to extend the HTTP protocol to develop new distributed authoring tools
in the web, specially emphasizing the collaborative authoring of web
pages.</p>

<p>The <em>lock mechanism</em> defined in WebDAV has been design to prevent
the resources overwriting (that is, to prevent the lost update problem) using
the operations lock and unlock. A lock controls the write access to a
resource by limiting HTTP writing operations, like PUT, POST and DELETE. This
means that only somebody who knows the lock will be able to execute those
operations. The WebDAV protocol also defines two <strong>lock
scopes</strong>: <em>an </em><em>exclusive and a shared lock</em>. An
exclusive lock guarantees that one person possess the lock, and no one else
will be able to lock the resource (it does not affect the resource reading).
A shared lock allows a group of users to create their locks over a resource,
but they must trust each other to prevent access problems. Besides, each lock
has a timeout, but the user cannot forget that locks may disappear in the
server due to exceptions in the server.</p>

<p>You can find more informations about WebDAV in <a
href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2518.html">RFC 2518</a> and also
at the <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV.org</a> website.</p>

<h3 id="WebDAV">WebDAV support in Amaya</h3>

<p>Amaya has an optional and limited support for WebDAV. This includes the
following operations: lock/unlock a WebDAV compilant resource, view the
WebDAV properties of a resource, and lock discovery capabilities. Besides, it
also includes some awareness functions, that can automatically inform users
about locked resources.</p>

<h3 id="Sharing">Sharing documents</h3>

<p>The WebDAV support present in Amaya intents to help small groups of users
to edit collaboratively their web pages. To illustrate how it works, here is
an example: supose that you have a WebDAV server (indeed, you
<strong>must</strong> have a Web server that supports WebDAV to work with it)
named <code>davserver.mycompany.com</code>, and you and your colleagues want
to edit collaboratively some documents that are in the WebDAV folder
<code>/shared/</code> (WebDAV folders are called collections).</p>

<p>So, imagine that you need to change the document
<code>http://davserver.mycompany.com/shared/Doc1.html</code>. To do so, you
load the document in your Amaya editor, and then you can <em>lock</em> this
document (<strong>Lock resource</strong> entry in
<strong>Tools/Cooperation</strong> menu. Once you locked the document, if one
of your colleagues tries to save some change in this document, s/he will be
warned about your lock, and updates will not be lost automatically. Thus,
while the document is locked, you can safely modify it, and when you have
finished your work and saved the document, you can <em>unlock</em> it,
allowing you colleague to lock the document and do his/her modifications.</p>

<p>If you want to be aware whether a colleague has locked a Web page, you can
use the <strong>View resource properties</strong> entry in the <strong>Tools
/ Cooperation</strong> menu to see all the properties of the page, or you can
configure Amaya to automatically inform you if the page is locked. To do so,
you will need to open the <strong>Preferences / WebDAV</strong> dialog box,
mark the <strong>General Awareness</strong> option and put your shared folder
name in the <strong>User's WedDAV Resource List</strong> field
(<code>http://davserver.mycompany.com/shared/</code>, in our example). Once
you did this, when loading a page locked by a colleague under
<code>http://davserver.mycompany.com/shared/</code> folder, you will be
notified by Amaya about this.</p>

<h3 id="WebDAV1">WebDAV options</h3>

<p>The following options can be set with the <strong>Preferences /
WebDAV</strong> dialog box. They are also available in the Amaya registry:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>User's personal reference (URL)</dt>
    <dd>An URL that identifies the user. Example:
      <code>mailto:myself@myhost.com</code> or
      <code>http://myhost.com/myhomepage.html</code> 
      <p>Registry: <code>DAV_USER_URL= [ URL ]</code></p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Lock Depth</dt>
    <dd>If depth is infinite, a lock over a collection (folder) will affect
      all components. Otherwise, the lock will affect only the collection,
      preventing an user that does not know the lock to create or remove
      components. 
      <p>Registry: <code>DAV_DEPTH= [ infinity | <strong>0</strong>
      ]</code></p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Lock Scope</dt>
    <dd>The lock scope: exclusive or shared. 
      <p>Registry: <code>DAV_LOCK_SCOPE= [ <strong>exclusive</strong> |
      shared ]</code></p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Lock Timeout</dt>
    <dd>The desired timeout for the lock. "Infinite" means that there is no
      timeout value, and "Other (Seconds)" will try to get a timeout value of
      <em>x</em> seconds (value <em>x</em> specified by the next field).<br />
      Registry: <code>DAV_TIMEOUT= [ <strong>Infinite</strong> | Second-XXXX
      ]</code></dd>
  <dt>General Awareness</dt>
    <dd>Indicates if you want basic awareness information about locked
      resources 
      <p>Registry: <code>DAV_AWARENESS= [ yes | <strong>no</strong>
      ]</code></p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Awareness on exit</dt>
    <dd>Indicates if you want to receive information about your own locks,
      when you leave a resource. 
      <p>Registry: <code>DAV_AWARENESS_ONEXIT=[ yes | <strong>no</strong>
      ]</code></p>
    </dd>
  <dt>User's WebDAV Resource List (URL URL)</dt>
    <dd>A list of the URLs of the resources you use as WebDAV resources. 
      <p>Registry: <code>DAV_URLS= [ URL URL URL ... ]</code></p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Compiling">Compiling Amaya with WebDAV</h3>

<p>WebDAV support is an optional feature of Amaya. To compile and use it, you
need the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Libwww with WebDAV support</li>
  <li>Amaya's configure option</li>
  <li>A WebDAV server to use this functions... <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a> and <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> are examples of web servers
    that support WebDAV.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you made the <em>cvs check-out</em> of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">Libwww with WebDAV</a> support and get <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html">Amaya sources</a>, you should
follow this bootstrap instructions (under Linux/Unix environments - for
windows environments, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">Libwww</a> homepage):</p>

<h4 id="libwww">At libwww folder:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>libtoolize -c -f</li>
  <li>perl config/winConfigure.pl</li>
  <li>aclocal; autoheader; automake; autoconf</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Amaya">At Amaya folder:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>autoconf</li>
  <li>mkdir LINUX-ELF (or GTK, or obj)</li>
  <li>cd LINUX-ELF</li>
  <li>../configure <strong>--with-dav</strong> ... (and all other options
    that you need)</li>
  <li>make</li>
</ul>
