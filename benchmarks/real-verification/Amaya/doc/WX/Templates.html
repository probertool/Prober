<h3 id="What">What is a template?</h3>

<p>Templates are used to produce multiple documents of the same type. A
template is a skeleton representing a given type of document, expressed in the
format of the final documents to be produced (XHTML, for instance). The format
of the final documents is called the target language and must be an XML
language.</p>

<p>In a template, the skeleton document contains some statements, expressed in
the XTiger language (eXtensible Templates for Interactive Guided Editing of
Resources), that specify how this minimal document can evolve and grow, while
keeping in line with the intended type of the final document. Documents
produced from this skeleton following the XTiger statements are called
<em>instances</em> of the template. Some parts of the template may be frozen,
if they have to appear in document instances as they are. Some parts may be
changed when producing an instance document, some others may be added either
freely or under some constraints.</p>

<p>The file containing a template must have a <code>.xtd</code> extension.</p>

<p>A template comes often with a set of accompanying resources (images, style
sheets, scripts). A template is a web resource, that can be stored in the local
file system or shared on a remote web server.</p>

<h3 id="Creating1">Creating a template</h3>

<p>You can create your own templates, using the XTiger language. However, Amaya
provides a specific support for creating or updating templates.</p>

<p>The proposed approach is to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create first a skeleton of the document instance (.html file) you want to
    generate.</li>
  <li>Select the Template (Tpl) tab of the <strong>Elements</strong> tool and
    click on the first entry to generate a template (.xtd file) from that
    document skeleton.</li>
  <li>When a template document is selected, several entries of the Template
    tool are available: 
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>Create and use a component</em> entry generates a
        <code>component</code> that will be displayed in the <code>head</code>
        of the template document. The current content of the selection becomes
        the content of the component. 
        <p>A <code>use</code> element that allows one to insert that component
        is created at the current position of the document. The selection must
        be valid (a set of complete elements or a string). The command asks the
        user for the <code>component</code> name. That name must be unique.</p>
        <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> The content of the component
        won't be edited in template instances. The user has to insert
        <code>use</code> and/or <code>bag</code> elements inside the component
        to define editable areas. These editable areas can be inserted before
        or after the creation of the component.</p>
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Create and repeat a component</em> entry generates a
        <code>component</code> that will be displayed in the <code>head</code>
        of the template document and a <code>use</code> element inside a
        <code>repeat</code> element. That command is a shortcut of the
        <em>Create and use a component</em> and <em>Repeat the current use</em>
        commands. 
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Create a new types union</em> entry generates a
        <code>union</code> which defines a new type as a choice between several
        basic types (<code>number</code>, <code>string</code>), elements from
        the target language (div, h1, h2, p, ...), or <code>component</code>
        names. The current selection has no effect. The command asks the user
        for the <code>union</code> name. That name must be unique. 
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Create a text area</em> entry generates a <code>use</code>
        element that includes a string. The command asks the user for a label.
        That label is free and is used for the selection path displayed in the
        status bar. The selection must be string and becomes the initial value
        of the use element. 
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Use a component or an element</em> entry is used to generate
        a new <code>use</code>. 
        <p>If the selection is empty, un dialog proposes the list of elements
        that can be inserted at that position and asks the user for the label
        to be associated with the new use element. A <code>use</code> element
        is generated with an empty content.</p>
        <p>If an element of the target language (div, h1, h2, p, ...) is
        selected, a <code>use</code> element that allows one to insert this
        element type is generated at that position. The selected element
        becomes the initial content of the use element. The command only asks
        the user for a label.</p>
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Repeat the current use</em> entry is used to generate a
        <code>repeat</code> of the current selected <code>use</code> element.
        The command asks the user for a label. That label is free and is used
        for the selection path displayed in the status bar. 
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Create a free editing box</em> entry generates a
        <code>bag</code> element. The command asks the user for a label. That
        label is free and is used for the selection path displayed in the
        status bar.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The created template can stored anywhere, in your local file system or
    remotely.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Visualizin">Visualizing template elements</h3>

<p>When a document instance is displayed, Amaya shows the XTiger elements under
the form of colored frames that enclose XHTML elements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <code>use</code> element is shown as a dashed blue box</li>
  <li>A <code>bag</code> element is shown as a dashed green box</li>
  <li>A <code>repeat</code> element is shown as a box with a <img
    alt="Repeat icon" src="../../resources/icons/16x16/TEMPLATE_repeat.png"
    width="16" height="16" /> on the top left</li>
  <li>The <code>attribute</code> element is not displayed in the main view, as
    it only impacts the <strong>Attributes</strong> tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>The XTiger elements can also be seen in the structure view. Open this view
with the <strong>Show structure</strong> entry of the <strong>Views</strong>
menu. In the structure view, XTiger elements are displayed in gold, while the
XHTML elements are in blue. XTiger elements are also shown in the Source view,
but with no special color.</p>

<p>Another way to understand the nesting of XTiger elements with XHTML elements
is the <strong>selection path</strong> displayed in the status bar of the
window (at the bottom of the window). There, you can see the list of all
elements in the structure of the document from the root element to the current
selection. It is updated every time the selection is changed. In this path,
XTiger elements are displayed in gold and XHTML elements in black. For XTiger
elements, it is not the name of the element that is displayed there
(<code>use</code>, <code>bag</code>, <code>repeat</code>) but the label of
these elements, as declared in the template.</p>

<h3 id="Selecting">Selecting templates</h3>

<p>You can select your own templates, or use the templates available on the
Amaya web site at <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Templates/">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Templates/</a></p>

<p>To ease selection among your favorite templates, there is a
<strong>Templates</strong> section in the Preferences dialogue
(<strong>Edit/Preferences</strong>, or <strong>amaya/Preferences</strong> under
Mac OS X). Use it to register the templates that Amaya proposes when you create
a new document. When registering a local template, you can call a file browser
with the browse button to locate and select the files to be added to the list.
You can also enter the URI of remote templates in the input area below the
list. Use the buttons on the right side of the list to remove a template or to
change the order of templates in the list.</p>

<p>Registering templates in this list is not mandatory. When you create a new
document instance, you can also choose a template that is not in that list.</p>

<h3 id="Creating">Creating an instance document</h3>

<p>To create a new document instance from a template, use entry <strong>New/New
document</strong> in the <strong>File</strong> menu. It displays a <a
href="Document.html">dialogue</a>  where you can select:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The template, either by selecting in the list of registered templates or
    by typing the URI or file name of a template that is not in the list.</li>
  <li>The URI or file name of the document instance you want to create.</li>
  <li>Where to open the new document (Replace current, In new tab, In new
    window).</li>
  <li>The Title of the new document that will be displayed by browsers (a
    default title is generated when the user doesn't specify it).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Editing">Editing an instance document</h3>

<p>Editing is allowed only inside the <code>repeat</code>, <code>use</code>,
and <code>bag</code> elements, i.e. within the colored dashed boxes. The rest
of the document is the fixed part of the template and can not be modified.</p>

<h4 id="Editing1">Editing in a <code>repeat</code> element</h4>

<p>In a <code>repeat</code> box, you can create new instances of the repeated
structure or you can delete one. This is controlled by the template, which may
impose a minimum and/or a maximum number of occurrences of the repeated
structure.</p>

<p>When creating new occurrences of the repeated structure is allowed, <strong
style="color:#1e90ff">+</strong> icons are displayed at locations where you are
allowed to create new occurrences. When you click on these icons, you get a
pop-up menu that tells you what can be inserted at that position. By clicking
in that pop-up menu, you create a new occurrence of the corresponding type. In
some cases the template offers only one type of occurrence. The pop-up menu
then contains a single entry, to clearly state what will be created. If you
click outside the menu, nothing is created.</p>

<p>Another way to create new occurrences of the repeated structure is to select
an existing occurrence, or to put the caret at the end of an occurrence, and to
press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. A new occurrence of the repeated structure is
then created, provided the maximum number of occurrences is not reached yet.
The type of the new occurrence is then the same as the one that was selected
when pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.</p>

<p>When an existing occurrence is empty or fully selected and the
<kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> key is pressed, the element is
deleted, provided the minimum number of occurrences is not reached yet.</p>

<h4 id="Editing3">Editing in a <code>use</code> element</h4>

<p>Most <code>use</code> elements (blue) allow you just to enter free text or
to freely replace/edit existing text. Other <code>use</code> elements offer a
choice between different types of elements that can be inserted at that
position. In that case, a blue triangle icon is displayed in the top left
corner of the box. By clicking this icon, you can select one of the allowed
types through a pop-up menu. When you have chosen a type, the corresponding
structure is generated and you can freely edit its content.</p>

<h4 id="Editing4">Editing in a <code>bag</code> element</h4>

<p>In a <code>bag</code> box (green), you can insert any number of elements of
the types specified by the template. When you want to insert a XHTML element,
do it the usual way provided this type is allowed by the template. It may
happen that some elements are not allowed by the template. The allowed elements
are listed in the <strong>Insert</strong> and <strong>Append</strong> submenus
of the contextual menu. The available template <em>components</em> are also
listed in the <strong>Insert</strong> and <strong>Append</strong> submenus of
the contextual menu.</p>
