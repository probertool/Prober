 *
 * 3 -  prototype.h has a new entry for csoundFTFindP() - see start of fgens.c.
 *
 * Table write ugens
 *------------------
 *
 *      These table write ugens are adapted from similar code in my modified,
 *      "bug free" version of the table read code in UGENS2.H & .C.
 *
 *      Ugens:          Subroutines:    Data structure:
 *

 *                      tablewkt()      "
 *--
 *
 *      These find out the length of a table, and write the guard point
 *      of a table.
 *
 *      Ugens:          Subroutines:    Data structure:

 *      itablecopy      itablecopy()
 *
 *      Two ugens which enable a rate reading and writing to sequential
 *      locations in tables.  Useful of a rate manipulation of table contents
 *      and conversely for writing a rate data into a table, where k rate
 *      code can manipulate it before it is written back to an a rate variable.

 *                      tablewa()
 *
 *------
 *
 *      The following ugens are fudges - it would be better to have arrays -
 *      like ablah[kx][ky].
 *
 *      Arrays should be local and global, multidimensional, a, k and i rate.
 *
 *      I will use these to get things done until arrays are implemented in
 *      the core of the language.
 *
 *      The zak system uses one area of memory as a global i or k rate
 *      patching area, and another for audio rate patching.

/*****************************************************************************
 *
 * Table write syntax
 *-------------------
 *
 * Use itablew when all inputs are init time variables or constants
 * and you only want to run it at the initialisation of the instrument.
 *
 * tablew is for writing at k or at a rates, with the table number being
 * specified at init time.
 *
 * tablewkt is the same, but uses a k rate variable for selecting the table
 * number.  The valid combinations of variable types are shown by the first
 * letter of the variable names:
 *
***     itablew   isig, indx, ifn [,ixmode] [,ixoff] [,iwgmode]
 *
***     tablew    ksig, kndx, ifn [,ixmode] [,ixoff] [,iwgmode]
***     tablew    asig, andx, ifn [,ixmode] [,ixoff] [,iwgmode]
 *
***     tablewkt  ksig, kndx, kfn [,ixmode] [,ixoff] [,iwgmode]
***     tablewkt  asig, andx, kfn [,ixmode] [,ixoff] [,iwgmode]
 *
 * isig, ksig,  The value to be written into the table.
 * asig
 *
 * indx, kndx,  Index into table, either a positive number range
 * andx         matching the table length (ixmode = 0) or a 0 to 1
 *              range (ixmode != 0)
 *
 * ifn, kfn     Table number. Must be >= 1. Floats are rounded down to
 *              an integer.  If a table number does not point to a
 *              valid table, or the table has not yet been loaded
 *              (gen01) then an error will result and the instrument
 *              will be de-activated.
 *
 * ixmode       Default 0  ==0  xndx and ixoff ranges match the length
 *                              of the table.
 *
 *                         !=0  xndx and ixoff have a 0 to 1 range.
 *
 *
 * ixoff        Default 0  ==0  Total index is controlled directly by
 *                              xndx.  ie. the indexing starts from the
 *                              start of the table.
 *
 *                         !=0  Start indexing from somewhere else in
 *                              the table. Value must be positive and
 *                              less than the table length (ixmode = 0)
 *                              or less than 1 (ixmode !=0

/* Known bugs in table write:
 *
 *      Watch out for giving a number (like "5" or p6) instead of a a rate
 *      variable to the index of table write ugens operating at a rate.
 *      The ugen gets a pointer to the number, but it is expecting a pointer
 *      to an a rate variable - which is an array of numbers.
 *      Upsamp the number (or k rate variable) to an a rate variable first.
 *
 *      This pitfall could be fixed with a revamp of how Csound processes the
 *      orchestra, or by making different named ugens for different types of
 *      variables.

/*****************************************************************************
 *
 * Other table manipulation ugens
 * ------------------------------
 *
*** ir  itableng ifn
*** kr  tableng  kfn
 *
 * ifn  i rate number of function table
 * kfn  k rate number of function table
 *
 *      These return the length of the specified table.  This will be a power
 *      of two number in most circumstances - it will not show whether
 *      a table has a guardpoint or not - it seems this information is not
 *      available in the table's data structure. If table is not found, then
 *      0 will be returned.
 *
 *      Likely to be useful for setting up code for table manipulation
 *      operations, such as tablemix and tablecopy.
 *
 *
***     itablegpw ifn
***     tablegpw  kfn
 *
 *      For writing the table's guard point, with the value which is in
 *      location 0.  Does nothing if table does not exist.
 *
 *      Likely to be useful after manipulating a table with tablemix or
 *      tablecopy.
 *
 *------
 *
***     tablemix  kdft, kdoff, klen, ks1ft, ks1off, ks1g, ks2ft, ks2off, ks2g
***     itablemix idft, idoff, ilen, is1ft, is1off, is1g, is2ft, is2off, is2g
 *
 *      This ugen mixes from two tables, with separate gains into the
 *      destination table.  Writing is done for klen locations, usually
 *      stepping forward through the table - if klen was positive.
 *      If it is negative, then the writing and reading order is backwards -
 *      towards lower indexes in the tables.  This bidirectional option makes
 *      it easy to shift the contents of a table by reading from it and
 *      writing back to it.
 *
 *      If klen is 0, no writing occurs. Note that the internal integer value
 *      of klen is derived from the ANSI C floor() function - which returns
 *      the next most negative integer.  Hence a fractional negative klen
 *      value of -2.3 would create an internal length of 3, and cause
 *      the copying to start from the offset locations and proceed for
 *      two locations to the left.
 *
 *      The total index for table reading and writing is calculated from the
 *      starting offset for each table, plus the index value, which starts
 *      at 0 and then increments (or decrements) by 1 as mixing proceeds.
 *
 *      These total indexes can potentially be very large, since there is no
 *      restriction on the offset or the klen. However each total index for
 *      each table is ANDed with a length mask (such as 0000 0111 for a table
 *      of length 8) to form a final index which is actually used for
 *      reading or writing.  So no reading or writing can occur outside
 *      the tables.
 *
 *      This is the same as "wrap" mode in table read and write. This process
 *      does not read or write the guardpoint.
 *
 *      If a table has been rewritten with one of these, then if it has a
 *      guardpoint which is supposed to contain the same value as the
 *      location 0, then call tablegpw afterwards.
 *
 *      The indexes and offsets are all in table steps - they are not
 *      normalised to 0 - 1.  So for a table of length 256, klen would be
 *      set to 256 if all the table was to be read or written.
 *
 *      The tables do not need to be the same length - wrapping occurs
 *      individually for each table.
 *
 * kdft         Destination function table.
 *
 * kdoff        Offset to start writing from. Can be negative.
 *
 * klen         Number of write operations to perform. Negative means
 *              work backwards.
 *
 * ks1ft ks2ft  Source function tables. These can be the same as the
 *              destination table, if care is exercised about direction
 *              of copying data.
 *
 * ks1off ks2off Offsets to start reading from in source tables.
 *
 * ks1g ks2g    Gains to apply when reading from the source tables.  The
 *              results are added and the sum is written to the destination
 *              table.
 *
 *---
 *
***     tablecopy  kdft, ksft
***     itablecopy idft, isft
 *
 *      Simple, fast table copy ugens.  Takes the table length from the
 *      destination table, and reads from the start of the source table.
 *      For speed reasons, does not check the source length - just copies
 *      regardless - in "wrap" mode.  This may read through the source
 *      table several times.  A source table with length 1 will cause
 *      all values in the destination table to be written to its value.
 *
 *      Table copy cannot read or write the guardpoint.  To read it
 *      use table read, with ndx = the table length.  Likewise use
 *      table write to write it.
 *
 *      To write the guardpoint to the value in location 0, use tablegpw.
 *
 *      This is primarily to change function tables quickly in a real-time
 *      situation.
 *
 * kdft         Number of destination function table.
 *
 * ksft         Number of source function table.

 *
*** ar     tablera  kfn, kstart, koff
 *
*** kstart tablewa  kfn, asig, koff
 *
 * ar           a rate distination for reading ksmps values from a table.
 *
 * kfn          i oro k rate number of the table to read or write.
 *
 * kstart       Where in table to read or write.
 *
 * asig         a rate signal to read from when writing to the table.
 *
 * koff         k rate offset into table. Range unlimited - see explanation
 *              at end of this section.
 *
 *      In one application, these are intended to be used in pairs, or with
 *      several tablera ugens before a tablewa - all sharing the same kstart
 *      variable.
 *
 *      These read from and write to sequential locations in a table at audio
 *      rates, with ksmps floats being written and read each cycle.
 *
 *      tablera starts reading from location kstart.
 *      tablewa starts writing to location kstart, and then writes to kstart
 *      with the number of the location one more than the one it last wrote.
 *      (Note that for tablewa, kstart is both an input and output variable.)
 *      If the writing index reaches the end of the table, then the no further
 *      writing occurs and zero is written to kstart.
 *
 *      For instance, if the table's length was 16 (locations 0 to 15), and
 *      ksmps was 5. Then the following steps would occur with repetitive
 *      runs of the tablewa ugen, assuming that kstart started at 0.
 *
 *      Run no. Initial Final   locations written
 *              kstart  kstart
 *
 *      1       0       5       0  1  2  3  4
 *
 *      2       5      10       5  6  7  8  9
 *
 *      3      10      15      10 11 12 13 14
 *
 *      4      15       0      15
 *
 *      This is to facilitate processing table data using standard a rate
 *      orchestra code between the tablera and tablewa ugens:
 *
 * ;-----------------------------
 *                              ;
 *      kstart = 0              ;
 *                              ; Read 5 values from table into an a rate
 *                              ; variable.
 *
 * lab1: atemp  tablera ktabsource, kstart, 0
 *
 *                              ; Process the values using a rate code.
 * atemp = log(atemp)           ;
 *                              ; Write it back to the table
 *
 * kstart tablewa ktabdest, atemp, 0
 *
 *                              ; Loop until all table locations have been
 *                              ; processed.
 * if ktemp > 0 goto lab1       ;
 *                              ;
 * ;-----------------------------
 *
 *      This example shows a processing loop, which runs every k cycle,
 *      reading each location in the table ktabsource, and writing the log
 *      of those values into the same locations of table ktabdest.
 *
 *      This enables whole tables, parts of tables (with offsets and different
 *      control loops) and data from several tables at once to be manipulated
 *      with a rate code and written back to another (or the same) table.
 *      This is a bit of a fudge, but it is faster than doing it with
 *      k rate table read and write code.
 *
 *      Another application is:
 *
 * ;-----------------------------
 *
 * kzero = 0                    ;
 * kloop = 0                    ;
 *                              ;
 * kzero tablewa 23, asignal, 0 ; ksmps a rate samples written into
 *                              ; locations 0 to (ksmps -1) of table 23.
 *                              ;
 * lab1: ktemp table kloop, 23  ; Start a loop which runs ksmps times,
 *                              ; in which each cycle processes one of
 * [ Some code to manipulate ]  ; table 23's values with k rate orchestra

 *
 *
 * koff This is an offset which is added to the sum of kstart and the internal
 *      index variable which steps through the table.  The result is then
 *      ANDed with the lengthmask (000 0111 for a table of length 8 - or
 *      9 with guardpoint) and that final index is used to read or write to
 *      the table.  koff can be any value.  It is converted into a long using
 *      the ANSI floor() function so that -4.3 becomes -5.  This is what we
 *      would want when using wide rangeing offsets.
 *
 *      Ideally this would be an optional variable, defaulting to 0, however
 *      with the existing Csount orchestra read code, such default parameters
 *      must be init time only.  We want k rate here, so we cannot have a
 *      default.
 *
 * Notes on tablera and tablewa
 *-----------------------------
 *
 *      These are a fudge, but they allows all Csounds k rate operators to be
 *      used (with caution) on a rate variables - something that would only
 *      be possible otherwise by ksmps = 1, downsamp and upsamp.
 *
 *      Several cautions:
 *
 * 1 -  The k rate code in the processing loop is really running at a rate,
 *      so time dependant functions like port would not work normally.
 *
 * 2 -  This system will produce undesirable results unless the ksmps fits
 *      within the table length.  For instance a table of length 16 will
 *      accomodate 1 to 16 samples, so this example will work with
 *      ksmps = 1 to 16.
 *
 *      Both these ugens generate an error and deactivate the instrument if
 *      a table with length < ksmps is selected. Likewise an error occurs
 *      if kstart is below 0 or greater than the highest entry in the table -
 *      if kstart >= table length.
 *
 * 3 -  kstart is intended to contain integer values between 0 and (table
 *      length - 1).  Fractional values above this should not affect operation
 *      but do not achieve anything useful.
 *
 * 4 -  These ugens do not do interpolation and the kstart and koff parameters
 *      always have a range of 0 to (table length - 1) - not 0 to 1 as is
 *      available in other table read/write ugens.  koff can be outside this
 *      range but it is wrapped around by the final AND operation.
 *
 * 5 -  These ugnes are permanently in wrap mode.  When koff is 0, no wrapping
 *      needs to occur, since the kstart++ index will always be within the
 *      table's normal range.  koff != 0 can lead to wrapping.
 *
 * 6 -  The offset does not affect the number of read/write cycles performed,
 *      or the value written to kstart by tablewa.
 *
 * 7 -  These ugens cannot read or write the guardpoint.  Use tablegpw to
 *      write the guardpoint after manipulations have been done with tablewa.

 *
 * The "zak" system
 * ----------------
 *
 *      The zak system uses one area of memory as a global i or k rate
 *      patching area, and another for audio rate patching. These are
 *      establised by a ugen which must be called once only.
 *
***     zakinit isizea, isizek
 *
 *      isizek is the number of locations we want to reserve for floats
 *      in the zk space.  These can be written and read at i and k rates.
 *
 *      isizea is the number of audio rate "locations" for a rate patching.
 *      Each "location" is actually an array which is ksmps long.
 *
 *      eg. zakinit 100 30 reserves memory for locations 0 to 100 of zk space
 *      and for locations 0 to 30 of a rate za space. With ksmps = 8, this
 *      would take 101 floats for zk and 248 floats for za space.
 *
 *      At least one location is always allocated for both zk and za spaces.
 *
 *      These patching locations can be referred to by number with the
 *      following ugens.
 *
 *      There are two short, simple, fast opcodes which read a location in
 *      zk space, at either i time or at the k rate.
 *
*** ir  zir     indx
*** kr  zkr     kndx
 *
 *      Likewise, two write to a location in zk space at i time or at the k
 *      rate.
 *
***     ziw     isig, indx
***     zkw     ksig, kndx
 *
 *      These are fast and always check that the index is within the
 *      range of zk space.  If it is out of range, an error is reported
 *      and 0 is returned, or no writing takes place.
 *
***     ziwm    isig, indx [,imix]
***     zkwm    ksig, kndx [,imix]
 *
 *      Like ziw and zkw above, except that they can mix - add the sig
 *      to the current value of the variable.  If no imix is specified,
 *      they mix, but if imix is used, then 0 will cause writing (like
 *      ziw and zkw) any other value will cause direct mixing.
 *
*** kr  zkmod   ksig, kzkmod
 *
 *      zkmod is a unit generator intended to facilitate the modulation
 *      of one signal by another, where the modulating signal comes from
 *      a zk variable.  Either additive or mulitiplicative modulation is
 *      provided.
 *
 *      ksig is the input signal, to be modulated and sent to the output
 *      of the zkmod unit generator.
 *
 *      kzkmod controls which zk variable is used for modulation.  A positive
 *      value means additive modulation, a negative value means multiplicative
 *      modulation.  A value of 0 means no change to ksig - it is transferred
 *      directly to the output.
 *
 *      For instance kzkmod = 23 will read from zk variable 23, and add the
 *      value it finds there to ksig.  If kzkmod = -402, then ksig is
 *      multiplied by the value read from zk location 402.
 *
 *      kskmod can be an init time constant, or a k rate value.
 *
 *
***     zkcl    kfirst, klast
 *
 *      This will clear to zero one or more variables in the zk space.
 *      Useful for those variables which are accumulators for mixing
 *      things during the processing for each cycle, but which must be
 *      cleared to zero before the next set of calculations.
 *
 *------
 *
 *      For a rate reading and writing, in the za space, we use similar
 *      opcodes:
 *
*** ar  zar     kndx
 *
 *      kndx points to which za variable to read.  This reads the number kndx
 *      array of floats which are the ksmps number of audio rate floats to be
 *      processed in a k cycle.
 *
*** ar  zarg    kndx, kgain
 *
 *      Similar to zar, but multiplies the a rate signal by a k rate value
 *      kgain.
 *
***     zaw     asig, kndx
 *
 *      Writes into the array specified by kndx.
 *
***     zawm    asig, kndx [,imix]
 *
 *      Like zaw above, except that it can mix - add the asig to the current
 *      value of the destination za variable.  If no imix is specified,
 *      it mixes, but if imix is used, then 0 will cause a simple write (like
 *      zaw) and any other value will cause mixing.
 *
*** ar  zamod   asig, kzamod
 *
 *      Modulation of one audio rate signal by a second one - which comes from
 *      a za variable.  The location of the modulating variable is controlled
 *      by the k rate variable kzamod.  This is the audio rate version of
 *      zkmod described above.
 *
***     zacl    kfirst, klast
 *
 *      This will clear to zero one or more variables in the za space.
 *      Useful for those variables which are accumulators for mixing
 *      things during the processing for each cycle, but which must be
 *      cleared to zero before the next set of calculations.
 *

/**************************************************************************
 *
 * Two ugens for printing at k rate
 *---------------------------------
 *
 *      printk prints one k rate value on every k cycle, every second or at
 *      intervals specified.  First the instrument number is printed, then
 *      the absolute time in seconds, then a specified number of spaces, then
 *      the value.  The variable number of spaces enables different values to
 *      be spaced out across the screen - so they are easier to view.
 *      This is for debugging orchestra code.
 *
***     printk  itime, kval [, ispace]
 *
 * itime How much time in seconds is to elapse between printings.
 *
 * kval  The number to be printed.
 *
 * ispace How many spaces to insert before it is printed.  (Max 120.)
 *        Default = 0.
 *
 *      The first print is on the first k cycle of the instance of the
 *      instrument.
 *
 *------
 *
 *      printks prints numbers and text, with up to four printable numbers
 *      - which can be i or k rate values.
 *
***     printks "txtstring", itime, kval1, kval2, kval3, kval4
 *
 * txtstring    Text to be printed first - can be up to 130 characters at
 *              least.  _Must_ be in double quotes.
 *
 *              The string is printed as is, but standard printf %f etc.
 *              codes are interpreted to print the four parameters.
 *
 *              However the \n style of character codes are not interpreted
 *              by printf.  (They are converted by the C compiler in
 *              string literals found in the C program.) This ugen therefore
 *              provides certain specific codes which are expanded:
 *
 *              \n or \N        Newline
 *              \t or \T        Tab
 *
 *              ^               Escape character
 *              ^^              ^
 *
 *              ~               Escape and '[' These are the leadin codes for
 *                              MSDOS ANSI.SYS screen control characters.
 *              ~~              ~
 *
 *              An init error is generated if the first parameter is not
 *              a string of length > 0 enclosed in double quotes.
 *
 *              A special mode of operation allows this ugen to convert
 *              the first input parameter into a 0 to 255 character, and
 *              to use it as the first character to be printed.  This enables
 *              a Csound program to send arbitrary characters to the console -
 *              albeit with a little awkwardness.  printf() does not have a
 *              format specifier to read a float and turn it into a byte
 *              for direct output. We could add extra code to do this if
 *              we really wanted to put arbitrary characters out with ease.
 *
 *              To acheive this, make the first character of the string a
 *              # and then, if desired continue with normal text and format
 *              specifiers.  Three more format specifers may be used - they
 *              access kval2, kval3 and kval4.
 *
 * itime How much time in seconds is to elapse between printings.
 *
 * kvalx The k rate values to be printed. Use 0 for those which are not
 *       used.
