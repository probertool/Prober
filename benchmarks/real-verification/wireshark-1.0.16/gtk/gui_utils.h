/** @page howto_window_page How to develop a window / dialog
 *
 * Windows and dialogs are related to each other. Dialogs are special kind of windows, but they behave
 * slightly different. Dialogs stick on it's parent window, normal windows will be much more independant
 * from it's parent window. Dialogs should be used to ask or note the user something, while windows should
 * show data independantly from the main window.
 * Dialogs are created by calling dlg_window_new() which in turn will call window_new().
 * After that, dialogs can be developed the same way as windows, all window related functions in gui_utils.h
 * can be used for both.
 *
 * @section window_create Create a window
 *
 * A typical window / dialog will be created by the following calls:
 *
 * - window_new() will create a new window with default position and size,
 *   use dlg_window_new() if you need a dialog (transient to the main window)
 * - gtk_window_set_default_size() to set the default size of the window. Only
 *   needed, if the initial size is not appropriate, e.g. when a scrolled_window_new() is used.
 *   Be sure that the given size is larger than the initial size, otherwise the window might
 *   clip the content (at least on GTK1)
 * - SIGNAL_CONNECT(my_win, "destroy", my_destroy_cb, NULL) callback, if some cleanup needs to be
 *   done after the window is destroyed, e.g. free up memory, or set the window pointer
 *   of a singleton window (only one instance allowed, e.g. about dialog) back to zero
 * - create and fill in the content and button widgets
 * - gtk_widget_show_all() shows all the widgets in the window
 * - window_present() present the window on screen and
 *   (if available) set previously saved position and size
 *
 * @section window_events Events
 *
 * The following events are usually interesting:
 *
 * - "delete_event": the window managers "X" (e.g. upper right edge) of the window
 *   was clicked, default handler will call gtk_widget_destroy()
 * - "destroy": everything is already gone, only cleanup of left over ressources
 *   can/should be done now
 *
 * @section window_hints Hints
 *
 * If you want to save size and position, be sure to call window_destroy() instead of only
 *   gtk_widget_destroy(), so you will probably have to SIGNAL_CONNECT to the "delete_event"!
 *
 * Don't use WIDGET_SET_SIZE() to set the size of a window,
 * use gtk_window_set_default_size() for that purpose!
 *
 * Be sure to call window_present() / window_destroy() appropriately, if you
 *   want to have size and position of the window handled by ui_util.
 *
