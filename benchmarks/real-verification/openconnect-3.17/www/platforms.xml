	<h1>Supported Platforms</h1>

<p>OpenConnect is known to work, with both IPv6 and Legacy IP, on Linux
(including Android), OpenBSD, FreeBSD (including Debian GNU/kFreeBSD), NetBSD, DragonFly BSD,
OpenIndiana/OpenSolaris, Solaris 10/11 and Mac OS X platforms, and should be trivially
portable to any other platform supporting
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP">TUN/TAP</a>devices and
on which <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> runs.</p>

<p>For Solaris support, and for IPv6 on any platform, the
<tt>vpnc-script</tt> shipped with vpnc itself (as of v0.5.3)
is not sufficient. It is necessary to use the script from my <a
href="http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/vpnc-scripts.git">vpnc-scripts</a>
repository instead.</p>

<p>
It is known to work on at least i386, x86_64, PowerPC and MIPS
processors, and should not have issues with portability to other CPUs.</p>
<p>Note that 'Cisco Secure Desktop' support may require the ability to run Linux/i386 binaries; see the <a href="csd.html">CSD page</a>.</p>

<h2>New Ports</h2>
<p>
Platform support for new UNIX systems is relatively simple to add
&#8212; most of the difference is in the TUN/TAP device handling, and
the major variants of that are already supported.</p>
<p>
A port to Windows should be fairly simple, since a TUN/TAP driver
exists for Windows and Cygwin should make the basic port work OK.</p>
<p>
A port to Symbian, to provide VPN connectivity on phone handsets,
would be very useful. Any volunteers?</p>
