	<h1>GUI Tools for OpenConnect</h1>

<h2>NetworkManager</h2>

<p>Support for OpenConnect in NetworkManager has been integrated into
GNOME git and is released alongside NetworkManager's other VPN modules:
<a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/NetworkManager-openconnect/">
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/NetworkManager-openconnect/</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to OpenConnect v3.00, the <tt>auth-dialog</tt>
tool which handles GUI authentication was part of OpenConnect itself,
rather than included in the <tt>network-manager-openconnect</tt>
package. Versions of <tt>network-manager-openconnect</tt> earlier than 0.8.4
will expect the <tt>auth-dialog</tt> to be provided for them, and thus will
not work with a version of OpenConnect any newer then v2.26.</p>

<p>To use OpenConnect v3.00 or newer with NetworkManager, you will need to be
using NetworkManager-openconnect v0.8.4 or newer.</p>

<p><b>Note for KDE users:</b> KDE does not support using OpenConnect with version 0.8 of NetworkManager <i>(unless of course you run OpenConnect manually from the command line and don't use NetworkManager for the VPN at all)</i>. It is only supported since 2011-06-22 with the NetworkManager 0.9, and with the corresponding <a href="https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/base/networkmanagement/repository/show?rev=nm09"><tt>nm09</tt></a> branch of the <a href="http://userbase.kde.org/NetworkManagement">kde-plasma-networkmanagement</a> widget.</p>
<p>This support was added by Ilia Kats, as <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226028">KDE bug #226028</a>.</p>

<h2>ConnMan</h2>

<p><a href="http://connman.net/">ConnMan</a> has core OpenConnect functionality
as from version 0.48, and the corresponding support is also in the
<a href="http://meego.gitorious.org/meego-netbook-ux/meego-panel-networks">meego-panel-networks</a>
user interface. Other ConnMan UI front ends may lack VPN support.</p>
