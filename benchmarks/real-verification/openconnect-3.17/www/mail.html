	<h1>Getting help</h1>

	<p>If you have problems building or using OpenConnect, or other questions or comments,
	<em>please</em> send email to the mailing list described below. You don't need to be
	subscribed to the list; you only need to click on the email address below, and send
	a <em>plain text</em> (not HTML) mail.</p>

	<p>A lot of people seem to post questions about OpenConnect on random web forums,
	where they are unlikely to get a quick or knowledgeable response. It's almost as if
	they don't <em>want</em> a coherent response, which is strange. Please, don't do
	that.</p>

    	<h1>Mailing list</h1>

	<p>There is a mailing list at <tt><a href="mailto:openconnect-devel@lists.infradead.org">
	openconnect-devel@lists.infradead.org</a></tt>. The list does not accept HTML email,
	so please make sure you post as plain text only.</p>

	<p>As mentioned above, you do <em>not</em> have to be subscribed to the list in order
	to post a question.</p>

	<p>It's usually best to read the recent messages in the <a href="http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openconnect-devel/">archive</a> before
	posting a question that is likely to have been asked before.</p>

	<p>If you do want to subscribe to the mailing list, you can do so from the <a href="http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/openconnect-devel">Mailman admin page</a>.</p>


	<p>
	  <b>SECURITY WARNING:</b><br />
	  If you are posting debugging output from openconnect to the mailing list, do <em>not</em> include a line which looks like this:
	  <br /><tt>Set-Cookie: webvpn=835278264@921600@1221512527@6B9EC24DEB2F59E242F75B424D42F223D0912984;PATH=/</tt><br />
	  That HTTP cookie is all that's needed to grant access to the VPN session you just logged in to â€”
	  it's almost as bad as giving your password away. Version 2.26 or later of OpenConnect will 
	  automatically filter this out of the debugging output for you.
