<h1>Contributing to OpenConnect</h1>

<a name="translation"></a>
<h2>Translations</h2>

<p>The main thing needed at the present time is translations into
languages other than English. All contributions will be gratefully
received.</p>

<p>Translations for OpenConnect can be entered through <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/openconnect/">Transifex</a>
or by editing one of the language files in the <tt><a href="http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/openconnect.git/tree/HEAD:/po">po/</a></tt>
directory and sending the resulting patch (or file) to the <a href="mail.html">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>If there are questions about the messages because the intent is not clear, or if the
messages could be improved to make translation easier or better, please also feel free to
ask or make suggestions on the mailing list.</p>



<h2>TODO</h2>

Other items on the TODO list include:

<ul>
  <li>Better support for running or emulating the '<a href="csd.html">Cisco Secure Desktop</a>' trojan.</li>
  <li>More platform support: Windows, Symbian, etc.</li>
  <li>GUI for OS X, perhaps based on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/">Tunnelblick</a>.</li>
</ul>
