    	<h1>Connecting to the VPN</h1>

<p>Once you have <a href="building.html">installed</a> OpenConnect and checked that you have a
<a href="vpnc-script.html">vpnc-script</a> which will set up the routing and DNS for it, using OpenConnect
 is very simple. As root, run the following command:<br/>
      <tt>openconnect --script /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script https://vpn.mycompany.com/</tt>
    </p>

That should be it, if you have a password-based login. If you use
certificates, you'll need to tell OpenConnect where to find the
certificate with the <tt>-c</tt> option. You might need to steal the
certificate from your Windows certificate store using a tool like <a
href="http://www.isecpartners.com/application-security-tools/jailbreak.html">Jailbreak</a>.
<p>
To start with, you can ignore anything you see in the <a href="technical.html">technical</a>
page about needing to patch OpenSSL so that DTLS works &#8212; you
don't really need it, although it will make your connections much
faster if you're experiencing packet loss between you and the VPN
server. But you can worry about that later.
