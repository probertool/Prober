real-effectiveness contains benchmarks with crashing input to show the effectiveness of Prober.

real-verification contains benchmarks[1] to show our instrumentation can cover all the cases in these 38 real-world benchmarks.

The LLVM is modified to make it support call our static instrumentation pass automatically in Link Time Optmization(LTO) stage.
